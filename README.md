# Quadcopter simulation using Jostick integrated with Arduino UNO

I was thinking, Is it possible to give input to a quadcopter using an analog joystick which we use for simple IOT projects. I watched youtube videos where they use a jostick to give input to flights or drones in simulation, so why not use this. I thought integrating this with Matlab and Simulink would be fun.

I had a joystick and a Arduino UNO with me, so I started to work on it.

### Step 1: Choosing a quadcopter

- The first step is to choose a quadcopter for simulation - I chose Pix4 Iris.
