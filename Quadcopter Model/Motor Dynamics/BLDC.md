# Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) Motor

## Introduction

- Brushless DC (BLDC) motors, also known as Electronically Commutated Motors, are a type of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) that operates on direct current (DC) power but uses electronic commutation instaed of mechanical brushes.

- Unlike traditional brushed DC motors, BLDC motors eliminate the need for physical brushes and commutators, which reduces wear, improves efficiency, and enhances reliability.

- They are widely used in applications requiring high efficiency, precise speed control, and long life, such as electric vehicles, drones, computer fans, and industrial automation.

- BLDC motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy through electromagnetic interactions between stator windings and rotor magnets. The "brushless" aspect refers to the absence of brushes, while "DC" indicates the input power source (though the internal operation mimics AC due to electronic switching)

## Working Principle

The core principle of a BLDC motor relies on the interaction between a permanent magnet rotor and a stator with electromagnets (windings). The rotor typically consists of permanent magnets arranged in poles (e.g., 2, 4, 6 or more), creating a magnetic field. The stator has multiple coils that are energized in a specific sequence to produce a rotating magnetic field, which "pulls" the rotor to follow it.
